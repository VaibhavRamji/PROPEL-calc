# TODOs

- [ ] Kill `br` everywhere
- [ ] Make sure bootstrap radiobutton group is named correctly (e.g. id names)
- [ ] Use my code as reference to add radiobutton groups as you see fit
- [ ] Stop capitalizing text. Use normal English.
- [ ] All buttons need to have some `border-radius` to make them smooth
- [ ] Make everything in html with some id
-[ ] add user input from propellant type selection and combustion cycle selection into js.
